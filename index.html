<h1>When Friendships Become Home</h1>
</header>
<section>
<p>There are stories that are told, and there are stories that are felt. Ours is not just about laughter, trips, or endless chats—it is about breaking, losing, healing, and finding our way back to each other.
</p>
<p>Our friendship was not born perfect, and maybe that’s the beauty of it. We came from different circles, stitched together by chance, tested by misunderstandings, torn apart by distance, and yet, somehow, we found our way back. What we thought was just friendship became something deeper—a home where we can always return.
</p>
<p>This is not just our story. It is a reminder that friendship is not about never falling apart, but about choosing to return, rebuild, and love stronger than before.

<h2>Our Journey</h2>
<p><b>Grade 7</b>
It began with five names: Reuel, Ericka, Roan, Mitzy, and Ashley. Different backgrounds, different personalities, but somehow we clicked. Lunch breaks, small talks, shared jokes—they turned into something bigger. We felt like we had found our circle, a family within school.
</p>
<p><b>Grade 8</b>
But friendships are never safe from struggles. Misunderstandings between Roan and Ashley caused distance. Soon after, Mitzy’s family moved to Canada. Just like that, from five we became three—Reuel, Ericka, and Ashley. The bond was still there, but the silence of missing voices was heavy.
</p>
<p><b>Grade 9</b>
Another rift came, this time between Ashley and Ericka. The friendship we thought was strong enough started to break down until only two remained—Reuel and Ericka. Still, no hatred stayed in our hearts, only the memories we shared.
</p>
<p><b>Grade 10</b>
Just when we thought it was over, something unexpected happened. On July 10, 2025, Roan came back. Not forced, not planned—just real. It all happened in our favorite spot, the street grind. For others, it was just an ordinary place. But for us, it became the heart of our story. That’s where we sat together again, after years of distance, with nothing but a simple game called comfort cards.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, it wasn’t just about being friends. It was about understanding each other on a deeper level. We went on road trips, laughed until our stomachs hurt, spent late nights talking, and even shared the weight of problems and expenses. In the middle of academic stress and personal struggles, we became each other’s rest.
</p>
<p>And in that, we found something more than friendship—we found home.

<p>Looking back, we realize that friendship is not defined by how long you’ve been together, but by how you find your way back after being lost.
</p>
<p>We are not perfect, but we are real. And in each other, we found not just friends—but a home.
</p>
<p>Just like the song says:<b>“Basta’t makasama ka, ako’y nakauwi na.”</b>
</p>
<p>“Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor: If either of them falls down, one can help the other up.” – Ecclesiastes 4:9-10
</p>
<p>Because in the end, friendship is not just about companionship—it is about lifting each other when the world feels too heavy.
